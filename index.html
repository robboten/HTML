                    <p>Wednesday is expelled from her high school after dumping live piranhas into the school's pool
                        while the boys' water polo team is practicing in retaliation for the team bullying her
                        brother
                        Pugsley. This leads her parents, Gomez and Morticia Addams, to enroll her in Nevermore
                        Academy
                        in Jericho, Vermont, a school for monstrous outcasts once attended by her parents.
                        Wednesday's
                        cold, emotionless personality and her defiant nature make it difficult for her to connect
                        with
                        her schoolmates and cause her to run afoul of the school's principal. However, she discovers
                        she
                        has psychic abilities that help her solve a local murder mystery.</p>

                    <h2>From one of the directors - Teddy Biaselli</h2>
                    <p class="datetime"><time datetime="2021-02-17"></time>17 Februari 2021</time></p>
                    <p>Who among us has never felt like an outsider? I truly believe that most people have, at one
                        time
                        or another, felt odd.
                        Maybe creepy. Kooky even. And perhaps because I was so tapped into my inner oddball, I found
                        a
                        deep kinship to the
                        family of Addams.</p>

                    <p>Whether it was the classic TV series, the brilliant movies, the recent Broadway musical or
                        even
                        their guest appearances
                        on Scooby Doo - every time the Addams Family was on a screen, I was watching. I loved that
                        at
                        every opportunity the
                        Addams skewered so-called “normality.” Their entire existence was a middle finger (attached
                        to a
                        disembodied hand) to
                        the status quo. And none was more rebellious, more avant garde and more iconic than
                        Wednesday
                        Addams.</p>

                    <p>Adolescence is an awful time for everyone. We’re growing hair in weird places, getting
                        taller,
                        breaking out, and all we
                        want is for people to like us. She is the ultimate lone wolf. She marches to her own beat...
                        and
                        it’s likely a funeral
                        dirge.</p>

                    <p>Netflix and MGM/UA are thrilled to announce the new live-action coming-of-age comedy
                        Wednesday
                        that will see everyone’s
                        favorite maiden of the macabre graduate into a full fledged leading lady.</p>

                    <p>When we first heard Al Gough and Miles Millar’s pitch for Wednesday we were struck, like an
                        arrow
                        from a crossbow, right
                        in our hearts. They nailed the tone, the spirit and the characters, but gave us a fresh way
                        into
                        this story. The
                        upcoming eight-episode series is a sleuthing, supernaturally infused mystery charting
                        Wednesday’s years as a student at
                        the peculiar Nevermore Academy. Wednesday's attempts to master her emerging psychic ability,
                        thwart a monstrous killing
                        spree that has terrorized the local town, and solve the supernatural mystery that embroiled
                        her
                        parents 25 years ago -
                        all while navigating her new and very tangled relationships of the strange and diverse
                        student
                        body.</p>

                    <p>We then got the call that visionary director and lifelong Addams Family fan Tim Burton wanted
                        to
                        make his television
                        directorial debut with this series. Tim has had a history of telling empowering stories
                        about
                        social outsiders like
                        Edward Scissorhands, Lydia Deetz, and Batman. And now he brings his unique vision to
                        Wednesday
                        and her spooky classmates
                        at Nevermore Academy.</p>

                    <p>The team also includes Andrew Mittman for 1.21 (The Addams Family, Alphas), Kevin Miserocchi
                        (Tee
                        and Charles Addams
                        Foundation), Kayla Alpert (Code Black, Up All Night), Jonathan Glickman for Glickmania
                        (RESPECT,
                        Addams Family 2), and
                        Gail Berman (The Addams Family, Alphas).</p>

                    <p>As Wednesday stans, my team and I feel an inherent responsibility to get this truly
                        one-of-a-kind
                        character right for
                        both old fans and new. We’re confident this talented group will do her justice as she
                        prepares
                        for the dreaded
                        underworld known as adulthood.</p>
